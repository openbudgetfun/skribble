# Cached rough geometry, per-widget seeds, a shipped refresh indicator

## Performance, held by regression gates

Every shape painter (`WiredRectangleBase`, `WiredCircleBase`, `WiredLineBase`, `WiredRoundedRectangleBase`, `WiredInvertedTriangleBase`) now has a const constructor and value equality, so the 128 call sites that build painters inline in `build` reuse their prepared rough geometry across ancestor rebuilds instead of re-running the generator, filler, and ink sampler. `WiredToggle`'s 250 ms thumb travel animates inside an `AnimatedBuilder` around a prebuilt child: a tick repositions the thumb and regenerates nothing. Icons whose `WiredSvgIconData` is built at runtime compare structurally, so they hit the icon painter cache that only const glyphs hit before. Loaders and skeletons stopped allocating `Paint` objects on every frame.

`package:skribble/testing.dart` ships `RoughGenerationCounter` and icon-cache stats so widget tests can pin all of this: rebuilding with an equal painter, a stable seed, or a runtime-equal icon must not move the counter, and a toggle animation must hold it flat. Those gates live in `test/perf/`.

## Per-widget seeds

Same-sized shapes of the same kind drew identical wobbles — a column of cards read as photocopies. `WiredCard`, `WiredChip`, `WiredChoiceChip`, `WiredBadge`, `WiredInput`, `WiredToggle`, `WiredRadio`, and `WiredOutlinedButton` now take a `seed` (null keeps the theme's), and `WiredCanvas` derives a memoised seeded config from it.

## WiredInput grows the common TextField surface

`enabled`, `keyboardType`, `textInputAction`, `inputFormatters`, `onSubmitted`, `maxLength`, `autofocus`, `prefix`/`suffix`, `prefixIcon`/`suffixIcon`, and `errorText` (which draws the ink and the message in the new `WiredThemeData.errorColor`); the doc comment no longer overstates the surface.

## Callbacks follow the framework convention

`WiredRadio.onChanged` is now an optional `ValueChanged<T?>` — null disables the radio — and `WiredToggle` takes `onChanged`; the boolean-returning `onChange` is deprecated but keeps its veto semantics for one migration window.

## WiredRefreshIndicator ships

Exported, tested, and documented. `WiredCustomRefreshIndicator` clears its spinner when a refresh fails (it wedged forever before), no longer announces its label twice, and `WiredContextMenu` ignores a long press that arrives after unmounting instead of throwing.

## Engine types stop lying about null

`OpSet`, `Drawable`, `EllipseParams`, `EllipseResult`, `ComputedEllipsePoints`, and `Edge` have required, non-nullable fields (breaking in the pre-1.0 sense), and a filler built without a configuration owns a fresh default random stream instead of advancing one shared global stream — identical calls now draw identically regardless of construction order. The Dart-to-JS parity fixtures are unchanged.
